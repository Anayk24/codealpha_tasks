# 🧮 Task 2: Matrix Operations in C

## 📌 Overview
This program demonstrates fundamental **matrix operations** in C using **functions**, **2D arrays**, and a **switch‑case menu** for modularity.  
It supports three essential operations:
- Matrix Addition
- Matrix Multiplication
- Matrix Transpose


## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this task is to strengthen understanding of **multi‑dimensional arrays** and **function‑based programming** in C.  
Matrix operations are widely used in computer science, data processing, and graphics, so this exercise builds a strong foundation for more advanced applications.
