## Overview
This project is a simple menu‑driven calculator written in C. It allows users to perform the four fundamental arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program uses a switch‑case structure to handle user choices, making it beginner‑friendly yet structured in a professional way.

 ## Purpose
The goal of this program is to demonstrate how core C concepts—such as input/output handling, conditional logic, and error checking—can be combined to build a practical tool. It’s designed as an internship task to strengthen problem‑solving skills and coding discipline.

## Features
Clear, easy‑to‑use menu interface.
Handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Division by zero check for safe execution.
Well‑documented code with inline comments for readability.
